# Installation for tar.bz2 or gzip,reference: http://www.technoreply.com/how-to-install-sublime-text-2-on-ubuntu-12-04-unity/
# unpack the tar.bz2 tar -jxvf 
# unpack the gzip tar -zxvf

1. Application location in ubuntu always place in "opt file"(means /opt/)

At some point you'd want to be able to call some Application from the terminal
So,to do that,we'll just call a symbolic link in "/user/bin" like thus:

2. sudo ln -s /opt/Sublime \ Text\ 2/sunblime_text /user/bin/Sublime
3. create a launcher in Unity
